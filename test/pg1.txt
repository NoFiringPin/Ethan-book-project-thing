1. Introduction

Rhythmic behaviors such as locomotion, respiration, feeding, and, in some animals
heartbeat are controlled by oscillatory neuronal netw orks

(Marder and Calabrese, 1996)
Furthe

rmore, wave-like rhythmic behaviors are characterized by

a temporal phase lag in
the activation of muscle

s. Classic examples of this type of behavior are the undulatory
swimming movements of the lamprey, leech, and

tadpole; and the beating ot crayfish
swimmerets (Grillner, 1999; Brodfuehrer et al.,

1995: Roberts et al., 1998 Mulloney et
al., 1998). A number of experimental and mathematical studies have investigated the
origin of phase lag in the nervous systems of these

animals. For example, in the lamprey

and the crayfish, the underlying neuronal network h

as been represented mathematically as
a chain of oscillators coupled in a nearest neighbor fashion (Kopell and Ermentrout
1988; Cohen et al., 1992; Skinner et al., 1997). Ina biological system this

mathematica
conceptualization corresponds roughly to a ne

uronal network in whic h local circurt
called “segmental oscillators,” that are independently capable of oscillation are coupled t
one another (Cohen et al., 1992

). For example, the neuronal network that underlies t
beating of the crayfish swimmerets can be viewed as

a chain of coupled segmental

oscillators because an isolated abdomina ganglion produces rhythmic motor output

similar in period and form to that of the intact network (Ikeda and Wiersma, 1964
Murchison et al., 1993) and because coordinated activity 1s the result of intersegme ntal

coupling (Stein, 1971; Paul and Mulloney, 1986; Namba and Mulloney. 1999)

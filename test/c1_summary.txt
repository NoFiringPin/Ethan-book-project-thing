Rhythmic behaviors like swimming in certain animals are governed by oscillatory neuronal networks controlling muscle activation with a temporal phase lag (Marder & Calabrese, 1996; Grillner et al., various years). These activities can be mathematically modeled as chains of independent segmental oscillators coupled in neighboring fashion. For instance, the crayfish swimmeret rhythm is represented by such a model where an isolated abdominal ganglion produces similar motor output (Ikeda & Wiersma, 1964; Murchison et al., 1993). Segmental coupling ensures coordinated activity among the oscillators. This concept provides insights into how phase lag in muscle activation can contribute to rhythmic behaviors like undulatory swimming and heartbeat control (Grillner, 1999; Roberts et al., 1998).

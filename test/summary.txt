In this text, it appears to be a blend of Old English and modern linguistic elements that don't form coherent sentences or narratives in any recognizable language such as German or French due to the mixing up words like "Britt", which does not seem relevant. It seems more likely that this is an attempted translation, but it lacks clarity because of errors made during transcription and lack of proper contextual references for accurate interpretation.

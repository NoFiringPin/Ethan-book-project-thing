Aim: To summarize the main findings of research studies investigating the origin and evolution of phase lag in neural oscillatory networks.

Introduction: The nervous system is composed of neurons that communicate with each other via neurotransmitters, which are released into synaptic boutons. Neural oscillations are generated by synchronized or anti-synchronized activity between different neuronal groups in a network.

Classic examples of phase lag behavior include the undulatory swimming movements of lamprey and the beatings of crazyfish.

Mathematical models have been used to represent the underlying neuronal networks in biochemical systems, allowing for a more detailed understanding of these phenomena.

Conceptualization: Phase lag is caused by the coupling between independent oscillating segments of a neural network. Segmental oscillators can be viewed as a chain of coupled segmental oscillators. The activity of individual neurons in a network is dependent on the synchrony or anti-synchrony between different groups.

Theoretical: Mathematical models have been used to explore the origin and evolution of phase lag in neural oscillatory networks. A mathematical conceptualization correlates neural oscillations with the coupling between segmental oscillators, which results in synchronized or anti-synchronized activity within a network.

Mathematical Models: An example of mathematical modeling is the work by Skinner et al. (1997), who used a mathematical model to investigate how neural networks evolve through time. The study shows that the dynamics of neural oscillations and segmental oscillators are coupled, resulting in phase lag behavior.

Biochemical Systems: Biochemical models have also been used to analyze the behavior of neuronal networks. For example, the swimmeret species in lampreys produces synchronized or anti-synchronized activity between different ganglia (the body segments). The modeling shows that synchrony and anti-synchrony between groups are correlated with phase lag behavior.

Conclusion: Phase lag is a fundamental aspect of neural oscillatory networks, whereby synchronized or anti-synchronized activity between independent groups can result in phase lag behavior. Mathematical models have been used to explore the origins and evolution of this behavior, and biochemical models have been used to further analyze the dynamics of these systems.

This document discusses rhythmic behaviors such as movement in various animals including lampreys, crayfish, tadpoles, etc. These activities are controlled by oscillatory neuronal networks which exhibit a phase lag between muscle activations due to nearest-neighbor coupling of segmental oscillators (local circuits) within the network. Studies have mathematically represented these biological systems and observed coordinated activity as an outcome of such connections, with specific emphasis on crayfish swimmerets where rhythmic motor output was maintained even when isolated abdominal ganglia were studied separately from their intact system. These investigations are important to understanding the origin of phase lag in these animals' nervous systems and contribute valuable insights into neuronal network functioning overall.

 The text discusses rhythmic behaviors in animals such as locomotion, respiration, feeding, heartbeat, and swimming, which are controlled by oscillatory neuronal networks. Specific examples include the undulatory movements of lamprey, leech, and tadpole, and the beating of crayfish swimmerets. Mathematical studies have modeled these nervous systems as chains of oscillators coupled to each other, with each local circuit capable of independent oscillation referred to as "segmental oscillators." This mathematical representation corresponds roughly to a neuronal network where each segment produces rhythmic motor output similar in period and form to the intact network. The coordinated activity is the result of coupling between these segmental oscillators.

 Introduction: Rhythmic behaviors such as locomotion, respiration, feeding, and heartbeat are controlled by oscillatory neuronal networks. Classic examples of wave-like rhythmic behaviors are the undulatory movements of the lamprey, leech, and tadpole, and the beating of crayfish rillner. Mathematical studies have investigated the origin of phase lag in the nervous systems of these animals. A biological system corresponds roughly to a neuronal network in which local circuits, called segmental oscillators, that are independently capable of oscillation are coupled to one another.

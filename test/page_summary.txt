Rhythmic behaviors controlled by oscillatory neuronal networks include actions such as locomotion and respiration. The phase lag in these rhythmic activities is often observed muscularly or behaviorally (Marder and Calabrese, 1996; Marder et al., 1057). These wave-like movements are seen across various species like lampreys, leeches, crayfish, etc. Studies have mathematically represented the neuronal networks of these animals (Kopell and Ermentrout, 1988), such as a series of oscillators in chains for example with each segment producing independent rhythmical output but still functioning together due to coupling mechanisms between them.

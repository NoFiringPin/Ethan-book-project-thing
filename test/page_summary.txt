Rhythmic behaviors such as locomotion, respiration, feeding in various animals are controlled by oscillatory neuronal networks. Classic examples include undulatory movements of lamprey ectopic parts (rillner), swimming activities involving crayfish muscles like heartbeat and swimmerets activation(Galiana et al., 1980; Katz, 1027; Brodfuehrer et al. , 1995) etc.. These rhythmic patterns in biological systems are characterized by phase lag between muscle activations which is due to the underlying neuronal network structure that has been mathematically modeled as a chain of oscillators coupled together (nearest neighbors). This mathematical conceptualization closely resembles how local "segmental" circuits, called “oscillators”, in an animal's nervous system are independently capable of rhythmic activities and synchronize their actions through coupling.

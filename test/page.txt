1. Introduction

| Rhythmic behaviors such as locomotion, respiration, feeding, and, in some animals,

| heartbeat are controlled by oscillatory neuronal networks (Marder and Calabrese, 1996).
Furthermore, wave-like rhythmic behaviors are characterized by a temporal phase lag in

muscles. Classic examples of this type of behavior are the undulatory

the activation of
ements of the lamprey, leech, and tadpole; and the beating of crayfish

al., 1998). A number of experimental and mathematical studies have investigated the

origin of phase lag in the nervous systems of these animals. For example, in the lamprey
and the crayfish, the underlying neuronal network has been represented mathematically as
a chain of oscillators coupled in a nearest-neighbor fashion (Kopell and Ermentrout,

1988; Cohen et al., 1992: Skinner et al., 1997). Ina biological system, this mathematical

> gail conceptualization corresponds roughly to a neuronal network in which local circuits,
called “segmental oscillators,” that are independently capable of oscillation are coupled to
one another (Cohen et al., 1992). For example, the neuronal network that underlies the

beating of the crayfish swimmerets can be viewed as a chain of coupled segmental

Oscillators because an isolated abdominal ganglion produces rhythmic motor output

Similar in period and form to that of the intact network (Ikeda and Wiersma, 1964;
of intersegmental

Murchison et al., 1993) and because coordinated activity is the result of in
coupling (Stein, 1971; Paul and Mulloney, 1986; Namba and Mulloney, 1999).

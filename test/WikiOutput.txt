 George W. Bush, born on July 6, 1946, is a former American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd U.S. president from 2001 to 2009. He was also the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. As a member of the Republican Party, he is the eldest son of the 41st president, George H. W. Bush.

Bush served in the Texas Air National Guard and later worked in the oil industry after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1975. He co-owned the Texas Rangers before being elected governor of Texas in 1994. As governor, he implemented several reforms including tort reform, increased education funding, school standardization, and criminal justice system improvements.

In the 2000 presidential election, Bush won over Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore, despite losing the popular vote following a disputed Electoral College win that involved a Supreme Court decision to halt a recount in Florida.

As president, Bush signed major tax cuts and education reforms, pursued socially conservative policies, initiated the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and launched wars in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), based on inaccurate beliefs about weapons of mass destruction and ties with al-Qaeda. He also signed the Patriot Act and Medicare Modernization Act during his presidency.

Bush's second term was marked by free trade agreements, Supreme Court appointments, failed attempts to reform Social Security and immigration laws, criticism for handling Hurricane Katrina and U.S. attorneys dismissals, and a loss of public support that led to the Democrats regaining control of Congress in 2006. The Afghanistan and Iraq wars continued, along with the Great Recession during his last year in office.

Post-presidency, Bush has maintained a low profile in Texas. His presidency was both highly popular after the September 11 attacks and deeply unpopular during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Although public opinion of Bush has improved since he left office, his presidency is generally considered below average by scholars.

 George Walker Bush is a former American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He was also the eldest son of the 41st president, George H. W. Bush, and a member of the Republican Party. Bush flew warplanes in the Texas Air National Guard in his twenties and worked in the oil industry. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers before being elected governor of Texas in 1994. As governor, he successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the criminal justice system. He also helped make Texas the country's leading producer of wind-generated electricity. During his presidency, Bush signed a major tax-cut program and an education-reform bill, the No Child Left Behind Act. He pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based initiatives. He also initiated the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, to address the AIDS epidemic. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, decisively reshaped his administration, resulting in the start of the war on terror and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Bush ordered the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan in an effort to overthrow the Taliban, destroy al-Qaeda, and capture Osama bin Laden. He signed the Medicare Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D. In 2004, Bush was re-elected president in a close race, beating Democratic opponent John Kerry and winning the popular vote. During his second term, Bush made free trade agreements and appointed John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws but both efforts failed in Congress. Bush was widely criticized for his handling of Hurricane Katrina and the midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys. Amid his unpopularity, the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. The Afghanistan and Iraq wars continued; in January 2007, Bush launched a surge of troops in Iraq. By December, the U.S. entered the Great Recession, prompting the Bush administration to get congressional approval for economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program. After his second term, Bush returned to Texas, where he has maintained a low public profile.
